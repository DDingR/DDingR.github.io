Mechanics of Materials Chapter2

## 2.2 Changes in Lengths of Axially Loaded Members

__Springs__

$$
P = k\delta
$$

- $k$ represents stiffness

__Prismatic Bars__

$$
\delta= {PL\over EA}
$$

- simply derived with definitions of stress and strain
- $EA/L$ can be considered as stiffness
- notice that $E$ Depends on cross section

## 2.4 Statically Indeterminate Structures

- find __equation of compatibility__
- use geometric features

## 2.5 Thermal Effects, Misfits, and Prestrains

__Thermal Effects__

$$
\epsilon_T = \alpha ( \Delta T ),\quad \sigma = E \alpha (\Delta T)
$$

- $\alpha$ is called the coefficient of thermal expansion
- when force and thermal effect at same time, total elongation is $\delta_T+\delta_P$

__Misfits__
- just means mis-fit
__Pre-Strain__
- existing force by misfits before applying force

## 2.7 Strain Energy

$$
U = W = \int_0^\delta P\,d\delta
$$

- can be called Strain energy, internal work

__Linearly Elastic Behavior__

$$
U=W={P\delta \over 2} = {P^2 L \over 2 EA} = {EA\delta^2 \over 2L}
