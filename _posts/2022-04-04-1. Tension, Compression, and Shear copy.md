Mechanics of Materials Chapter1

## 1.4 Normal Stress and Strain

__Normal Stress__

$$
\sigma = P/A =[\text{N/m}^2] = [\text{Pa}]
$$
- Tensile, Compression Stress
- Tensile stress has positive value

__Normal Strain__
$$
\epsilon = \delta / L = [\text{m/m}] = [\quad]
$$
- elongation per unit length

> all statements above is under assumptions  
> 1. Prismatic bar (constant cross section)
> 2. isotropic
> 3. force applied at center of cross section

__Moment__
$$
M_x = P\bar{y} = \int \sigma y \,dA = [\text{N} \cdot \text{m}]
$$
- $\bar{y}$ represents the y coordinates of arbitrary cross section where force is applied 

## 1.5 Mechanical Properties of Materials

__Stress-Strain Diagrams__
- be ware of differences between nominal and true 
![_config.yml](/images/MechanicsOfMaterials/SS_diagram.png)
- dot line describes true diagram, line means engineering one
- yield point is defined at 0.2% deformation of linear region

__Compression__

- Compression experiment is easier. cauese no necesary of place to hold
- notice. Young's modulus would be not same on tensile and compression test
- usually, tensile test use to plot SS-curve and compression for precise point between elastic and plastic

## 1.7 Linear Elasticity, Hooke's Law and Poisson's Ratio

__Hooke's Law__

- only focus on linear region on this book
  
$$
\sigma = E \epsilon
$$

__Poisson's Ratio__

$$
\nu=-{\text{lateral strain} \over \text{axial strain}} = -{\epsilon'\over\epsilon}
$$

- negative sign. because the directions are not same


## 1.8 Shear Stress and Strain

__Shear Stress__

$$
\tau = V/A = [\text{N}/\text{m}^2]
$$
- shear stress on perpendicular plane has same value reverse direction
- shear stress only changes shape (e.g. fluid)
- normal stess changes length, form

__Shear Strain__
$$
\gamma = [\quad]
$$

- no unit
- change of angle

__Hooke's Law in Shear__

$$
\tau = G \gamma
$$
- in this case $G$ is "Shear modulus of Elasticity"

$$
G = {E\over 2(1+\nu)}
$$
- remember above relationship between $E$ and $G$

## 1.9 Allowable Stresses and Allowable Loads

__Factors of Safety__
$$
\text{Factor of Safety} \ n = {\text{Actual strength} \over \text{required strength}} 
$$
